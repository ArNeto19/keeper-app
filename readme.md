# React Keeper App

The idea of this project is to be a challenge for practice the recently acquired knowledge about app development with React.js.

It was directly inspired by the Google Keep App, and try to emulate their functionalities, but only as a matter of study and practice.

It is possible to view the the results on this codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/ihd9k2

I would like to thanks @angelabauer for all the shared knowledge.
